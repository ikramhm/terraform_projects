This project is a work in progress. It attempts to build the current stack for mystorybucket.com (see appropriate repository for architecture design). After the terraform configuration is fully acheived, I will use terraform import to bring mystorybucket.com under Terraform management. Currently, a requirement for terraform import is that terraform configuration of the stack must be complete first. Only then, can the statefile of the created resources map to the existing infrastructure, and thus, allow the import to take place.

The Terraform project provisions a CloudFront-ACM-S3 bucket for secure static website hosting. It acheives this through a terraform module from the public registry. It also provisions a Lambda function which invalidates the CloudFront cache when S3 events notes an update to the S3 index object (index.html) which serves the webpage.

To move this project forward, two relatively straightforward steps remain. First, the "S3-object" resource needs to be encoded to provision index.html and index.css; As expected, this resource will use the file module. Second, the Route53 resources needs to be configured, with an alias record pointing to the CloudFront distribution. Notwithstanding an existing bug in the current configuration, these two steps 'SHOULD' (and I say should, tentatively) allow for the Terraform import to take place.
